Woot! The project reached its "50 GitHub Stars" Milestone 10 days early! :)

Originally targeting Xmas (2025-12-25) it was reached today. Thanks to all supporters! Keep the stars coming!

Today I also started testing the auto-load and lifecycle adapter implementation in Godot. It now auto-loads reliably, all it takes is the usual "enable plugin" step in the UI - which I tried to bypass but all solutions turned out to be unreliable.
