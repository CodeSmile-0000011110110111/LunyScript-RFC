Woot! The project reached its "50 GitHub Stars" Milestone 10 days early! :)

Originally targeting Xmas (2025-12-25) it was reached today. Thanks to all supporters! Keep the stars coming!

Today I also started testing the auto-load and lifecycle adapter implementation in Godot. The lifecycle hook now auto-loads when the player launches. All it takes is the usual "enable plugin" step in the UI.
 
 I wanted to bypass this annoying UI step but the solutions just weren't 100% reliable. So it remains KISS, and an optimization for the future.
