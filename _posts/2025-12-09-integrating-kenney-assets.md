I started adding all the Kenney.nl assets to my Proof of Concept project in order to prepare some of the assets for later.

I need to add colliders, set up physics body, and I'm adding a couple lights since the block-based sequences make adding these details trivial.

Here's a quick gif showcasing the lights in action:

The pixelated retro style also serves these simplistic models well.

Then .. one thing led to another and I got this:
