I applied LunyScript to a federal FOSS fund by the german state ("Software Sprint") on Nov 30th after two months of 10+ hours a day, 6 days a week of work. 

Now I'm trying to get the word out and it's encouraging to see the GitHub star counter ticking up every day by an average of two stars. Nice! :)

If you haven't already and LunyScript seems like a worthwhile project to support, please leave a star and tell your friends and viewers about it!

Besides the ![animated GIF](../media/LunyScript_Demo.gif) there's a full length demo video (1:20), a poking-fun at boilerplate hell video (40s) and now a phone-compatible short, portrait-style (15s) - that's currently my marketing material I work with, and I'm working on setting up more variety via the proof of concept project.
