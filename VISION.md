# The Luny Vision

We can't change game engines' unique workflows and user interfaces.
But we **can** lessen the impact of their disparate APIs and languages!

## Vision Statements

A sustainable scripting solution shall be:

**Portable & Open:**
- Works in multiple engines, not just one
- Works in any language, not just one
- Is an API, not a language
- Code is portable between engines
- Is free and open source

**Beginner- & Designer-Friendly:**
- Declarative, expressing intent
- Fault-tolerant, using placeholders instead of crashing
- On-screen instrumentation over debugger deep-dives
- Bite-sized code extensions teach modular thinking & engine API
- Unlocks engines: portable code libraries

**Production-Ready:**
- Powerful: Built-In Statemachine and Behaviour Trees
- Supplements existing code and tools
- Promises <5% performance overhead
- Is easy to extend and bypass

## The Outcome

Pro-tier engines across the board will be more approachable and conducive to beginners. They learn valuable concepts and patterns before diving into imperative programming - rather than vice versa.

Learnfluencers provide valuable head-to-head engine comparisons and can afford time to demo less popular engines. This could help niche engines to gain popularity.

Education adopts a single entry-level game programming curriculum. Easier to encourage non-programmers to code.

Visual Scripting users find themselves more productive in text-based declarative programming. Simple projects complete faster. Game Jams produce reusable code. Prototypes are less concerned with technical issues. Trying a different engine is easier.
