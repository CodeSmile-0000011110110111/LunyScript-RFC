# The Vision

We can't change game engines' unique workflows and user interfaces.
But we CAN lessen the impact of their disparate APIs and languages!

## Statements

A sustainable scripting solution shall be:

**Portable & Open:**
- Works across multiple engines, not just one
- Is an API, not a language
- Can be exposed in many languages
- Is Free and Open Source

**Beginner-Friendly:**
- Declarative, using expressive language
- Bite-sized code teaches modular thinking
- Fault-tolerant, using placeholders instead of crashing
- On-screen instrumentation over debugger deep-dives

**Production-Ready:**
- Provides proven design patterns
- Supplements existing code and tools
- Promises <5% performance overhead
- Is easy to extend or bypass

## The Outcome

Pro-tier engines across the board will be more approachable to beginners. They learn valuable concepts and patterns before diving into imperative programming.

Education adopts a single entry-level game programming curriculum.

Learnfluencers provide valuable head-to-head engine comparisons and can afford time to demo less popular engines.

Prototypes can be tested in multiple engines to find the most suitable solution.

Simple projects complete faster. Game Jams produce reusable code. Prototypes struggle less with technical issues. Visual Scripting users find themselves more productive in text-based declarative programming.
