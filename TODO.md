# TODO: README Improvements for RFC


## High Priority

- **Add concrete code comparison** - Show Unity vs Godot vs LunyScript side-by-side for same feature (e.g., collision handling). Currently placeholders at lines 32, 144, 186
  - Quantify claim via examples
  - Analyse "same task, multiple engines" status quo (boilerplate, semantics)
  - Hunch: GDScript is very short, but is this offset by more UI clicks?

## Medium Priority

- **Organize sections logically** - Current flow: pitch → philosophy → vision → solution → story → summary → description. Restructure to: pitch → solution (with code) → use cases → proof → vision/philosophy
- **Update roadmap** - Proof of concept is done (2024). What's the actual current status and next milestones?

## Low Priority


## Questions to Address

- What's the actual ask? (feedback, collaborators, funding, users?)
- How can people try it? (demo, playground, install instructions)

## Thoughts, Ideas
