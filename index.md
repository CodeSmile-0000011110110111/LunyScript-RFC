# **LunyScript:** Your Game Programming Gateway

## 🎮 You want to make games? Great! 😃

But Godot/Unity code is confusing, complex, and completely different everywhere? 😵‍💫

LunyScript is your **🫵 fast-lane, front-row ticket 👑** to **C#** game programming!🕹️🧑‍💻

```csharp
public MyPlayer()
{
    When.Collision.With("ball")
        .Begins(Audio.Play("energy_buildup"))
        .Ends(Spawn("sparkles"), Event.Send("kick").To("ball"));
}
```
Why learn pointless differences like`_init`,`Awake`,`BeginPlay`when you just want to make your dream game come true? 😄 Learn the editor first, engine code later. 🥳 
<br/><sub>I used LunyScript to create a game in three engines simultaneously:<sub>

## **✨ Same Code - Many Engines ✨**

LunyScript let's you program everything game engines have in common: <br/>🕹️Input 👁️Camera ⚽Physics 🏃Animation 🎸Audio 📱UI️ 🎭Scenes 🪜Objects ➕➕

- **Godot and Unity**: Easier to program than Roblox & GameMaker 😏🤗<br/><sup>For **Godot** and **Unity** (ETA 2026/27) [⏰ Join Patreon for updates! 🔔](https://www.patreon.com/CodeSmile){:target="_blank"}</sup> 
- **No runtime errors**: Stay in the flow of creating 🎨🎧<br/><sup>Mi<ins>ts</ins>akes happen! See and inspect issues where they occur: in-game.</sup>
- **Experiment**: Trial and error is encouraged 🧪🥼<br/><sup>Pure creative joy! Avoid getting drawn into **Tutorial Hell**!</sup>
- **Concise**: 3-5 times less code than GDScript 🤫🧘<br/><sup>Code is clear and consistent! No CS jargon. No visual scripting spaghetti.</sup>
- **Powerful**: Enough to create a _Megabonk_ 👑💎<br/><sup>Learn valuable concepts: StateMachines, BehaviorTrees, Sequences.</sup>
- **Ready for more**: LunyScript extends easily 🛝🚀<br/><sup>Transition to engine APIs one small step at a time, at your own pace.️️</sup>
- **Skip dead-ends**: Learn the **career language C#** 🧑‍🎓🧑‍💻<br/><sup>Defer the scary syntax but work like a Pro with Rider, VS, VSCode.</sup>
- **Escape lock-in**: Same code, works everywhere 🔑🔓<br/><sup>Dislike the editor? Community unhelpful? No jobs? Switch engines, keep the code!️</sup>

LunyScript is the beginner-friendly, high-level game programming DSL that works **uniformly across game engines**. It's free and open source (MIT License).

## **More Accessible Code Prevents Tutorial Hell**

<sub>Game engine's 'full flexibility' programming problem in a nutshell:</sub>
<iframe width="648" height="365" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PfZ4VBui_Wo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

LunyScript provides **easy entry** into game engine programming.
It teaches **modular design** and **creation through experimentation**.
Users **transition gradually** to native programming expertise, while LunyScript **remains useful** in their toolbox.
 
The core concepts behind LunyScript have been **proven in production** over several titles. Designers loved the **consistency and extensibility**. 
**Onboarding and documentation** was easy. 

**I know** that the amalgamation of **design as code** works and provides **huge benefits** to all **creative thinkers and tinkerers**. You'll find my rationale in these documents: 

**→ [The Problem Statement](docs/ProblemStatement)** that lead to LunyScript.
<br/>**→ [About me and my experience](AUTHOR.md)** that formed LunyScript.
<br/>**→ [The vision](VISION.md)** for LunyScript, now and beyond.
<br/>**→ [The philosophy](docs/Philosophy.md)** of LunyScript explains why it's feasible.
<br/>**→ [The maintenance strategy](MAINTENANCE.md)** details how LunyScript is manageable.
<br/>**→ [Compare LunyScript code](docs/CodeComparison.md)** with GDScript, C#, Roblox to see its benefits.

## **🤨 Any Engine?? Das Crazy! 🤯**

Game engines make games. They share the same essential features for a [_Megabonk_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3405340/Megabonk/){:target="_blank"}.
Most games don't need much more. Why bother programming them differently?

API standardization has escaped game engines for all the wrong reasons: competition, pride, control, evolution.
_Games are different_ so engine code must be too. **Wrong!** 😲

**Proof**: Unreal, Unity, Godot: same game, same code.🫡 -- **They said it's impossible!**🤔
