# LunyScript - Your Game Coding Heaven

---
## **Code That Speaks To You!**

```csharp
When.Collision.With("ball")
    .Begins(Audio.Play("energy_buildup"))
    .Ends(Spawn("sparkles"), Audio.Play("kick"));
```

Game Over For Tutorial Hell! 🤗

# **🎮 LunyScript 🎮**
The powerful and user-friendly alternative to visual scripting. **Portable code!**

## 🟰 **Same Code - Any Engine** 🟰 

LunyScript unifies high level gameplay programming across engines. Enough to create the next _Megabonk_.

_Coming soon: **Unity**<sup> Q2/2026</sup> - **Godot**<sup> Q4/2026</sup> - .._

## 🤨 **Any Engine?? Das Crazy!** 🤯

Pro-Tier engines diverge only in high-end features, and the front-end (UI). **Proof**: Same Code, Three Engines:

## 🙌 Benefits 🎉

- Code without the boilerplate mumbojumbo.
- Learn valuable concepts like a scientist: by experimenting.
- Visible placeholders instead of _NullReference_ crashes.
- Extensible with 'real' code - bite-sized. When you're ready.
- Try another engine? Keep your assets **and** your code!
- Vibe coding generates relatable results to learn from.
- The best? LunyScript is fast with 66% less boilerplate.

# What if ..❔
## .. programming Unity and Godot were easier than Roblox?

Code reads like intent. Simple to extend: one method at a time. No event registration. No coroutine yielding. No async await anything. Just plain script, but in C#.

## And it were powerful enough to create _Megabonk_?

With accessible Statemachines and Behaviour Trees, but without the CS jargon: `Run.Together` instead of `Parallel`. You won't even miss a visual editor.

# What if ..❔
## .. all game engines shared the same programming interface?

LunyScript uniformly maps the high-level gameplay features all game engines have in common: Input, Physics, Assets, Audio, Scene Graph, and many more. One API to rule them all.

## And code behaved the same in Unity and Godot?

Assets already transfer, now code is portable, too. Create more value: integrated cross-engine libraries, multi-engine coding tutorials, ...

# What if ..❔
## .. it were free, and open source?

It is.

# **This can't possibly work!!**

It does! Here's proof: same code, same game, runs in Unreal, Unity, and Godot - in less than 20 days. **[=> Watch the full video on YouTube (1:20)](https://youtu.be/Vn38VLNDsuw)**

**→ [API design philosophy and principles](docs/Philosophy.md)**<br/>
**→ [FOSS-compliant AI-assisted development](AI-USAGE.md)**<br/>

Planned API would port well to Stride, Flax, Unigine, Evergine, CryEngine, and Unreal (UnrealSharp).

# **Roadmap**

- **Phase 1:**<br/>Unity (C#); API Design; Portable Layer; Demos and Docs (Q2 2026)
- **Phase 2:**<br/>Godot (C#); Cross-Engine Tests; Improve onboarding (Q4 2026)
- **Phase 3:**<br/>Demos & Docs; Promote; Stabilize; (Q2 2027)

_Under Consideration_
- Lua Bindings: For even easier scripting.<br/>
- 2D Support: Initial focus is on 3D games.
