# Engine Differences

## Overview

LunyScript provides a uniform API across game engines by abstracting their architectural differences. This document details how Godot, Unity, and Unreal differ structurally, and how LunyScript unifies them.

## Scene Graph Architecture

### Engine Comparisons

**Godot: Node Hierarchy (Contextual Components)**
```
Scene
└── RigidBody3D "Player"
    ├── CollisionShape3D (component-like child)
    ├── MeshInstance3D (component-like child)
    ├── Node: PlayerController.gd (script)
    └── Node3D "Weapon" (object-like child)
        └── MeshInstance3D (component-like child)
```

**Unity: GameObject + Components**
```
Scene
└── GameObject "Player"
    ├── Component: Transform
    ├── Component: Rigidbody
    ├── Component: PlayerController (script)
    └── GameObject "Weapon" (child)
        ├── Component: Transform
        └── Component: MeshRenderer
```

**Unreal: Actor + Components**
```
Level
└── Actor "Player"
    ├── Component: RootComponent (SceneComponent)
    │   └── Component: StaticMeshComponent
    │       └── Component: CapsuleComponent
    ├── Component: CharacterMovementComponent
    ├── Component: PlayerController (script/blueprint)
    └── Component: ChildActorComponent "Weapon"
        └── Actor reference with nested components
```

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Godot | Unity | Unreal |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| **Primary Structure** | Node hierarchy | GameObject + Components | Actor + Components |
| **Child Semantics** | Context-dependent (objects OR components) | Always sub-objects | Components or nested actors |
| **Script Attachment** | Node property | Component | Component or blueprint |
| **Transform** | Inherited from node type | Component | Component (SceneComponent) |

### LunyScript Unification

LunyScript treats all entities uniformly as **Objects** with **Behaviors**:

```csharp
// Works identically across all engines
When.Self.Spawns(
    Get.Child("Weapon").Transform.Position = Vector3.Up * 2
);

// Godot: Finds child node "Weapon"
// Unity: Finds child GameObject "Weapon"
// Unreal: Finds child component or actor "Weapon"
```

**Unified Hierarchy Model:**
```
Object "Player"
├── Behavior: LunyScript behaviors
├── Children: Nested objects
└── Properties: Transform, Physics, etc.
```

Adapters translate:
- Godot: Node → Object, Node children → Object.Children (contextually)
- Unity: GameObject → Object, MonoBehaviour → Behavior attachment point
- Unreal: Actor → Object, ActorComponent → Behavior attachment point

## Lifecycle Events

### Engine Comparisons

**Godot Lifecycle**
```
Constructor
    ↓
_init()         // Node initialization
    ↓
_ready()        // Scene tree ready (like Start)
    ↓
_enter_tree()   // Added to scene tree (can repeat)
    ↓
_process()      // Per-frame update
_physics_process()  // Physics timestep update
    ↓
_exit_tree()    // Removed from scene tree
    ↓
(Node destroyed when no references - no reliable destruction callback)
```

**Unity Lifecycle**
```
Awake           // Object initialization, called once
    ↓
OnEnable        // Called when enabled (can repeat)
    ↓
Start           // First frame initialization
    ↓
FixedUpdate     // Physics timestep update
Update          // Per-frame update
LateUpdate      // After all Updates
    ↓
OnDisable       // Called when disabled
    ↓
OnDestroy       // Cleanup before destruction
    ↓
(Object destroyed)
```

**Unreal Lifecycle**
```
Constructor
    ↓
PostInitializeComponents  // After all components initialized (used for Awake/_init purposes)
    ↓
BeginPlay       // When gameplay starts
    ↓
Tick            // Per-frame update (enacts all update types)
    ↓
EndPlay         // When gameplay ends or destroyed
    ↓
BeginDestroy    // Cleanup phase
    ↓
(Object destroyed)
```

### Lifecycle Comparison Table

| Phase | Godot                     | Unity             | Unreal |
|-------|---------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Construction** | _init()                   | N/A (discouraged) | Constructor |
| **Pre-Start Init** | N/A                       | Awake             | PostInitializeComponents |
| **Enable/Enter** | _enter_tree()             | OnEnable          | BeginPlay |
| **First Frame** | _ready()                  | Start             | BeginPlay |
| **Physics Step** | _physics_process()        | FixedUpdate       | Tick |
| **Per-Frame** | _process()                | Update            | Tick |
| **Late Update** | N/A                       | LateUpdate        | Tick |
| **Disable/Exit** | _exit_tree()              | OnDisable         | EndPlay |
| **Destruction** | N/A (unreliable) | OnDestroy         | EndPlay + BeginDestroy |

### Key Behavioral Differences

1. **Enable/Disable:**
   - Godot: _enter_tree/_exit_tree (scene tree membership, can repeat)
   - Unity: OnEnable/OnDisable (can be toggled, can repeat)
   - Unreal: BeginPlay/EndPlay (typically once per gameplay session)

2. **Destruction:**
   - Godot: No reliable destruction callback (garbage collected when no references)
   - Unity: OnDestroy called explicitly
   - Unreal: EndPlay (covers multiple scenarios), BeginDestroy (final cleanup)

3. **Update Phases:**
   - Godot: _process() and _physics_process() (no late update)
   - Unity: FixedUpdate (physics timestep), Update, LateUpdate (separate phases)
   - Unreal: Tick (enacts all update types in one callback)

### LunyScript Unified Lifecycle

```
OnAwake         // First setup (maps: Awake/_ready/PostInitializeComponents)
    ↓
OnEnable        // Object becomes active (maps: OnEnable/_enter_tree/BeginPlay)
    ↓
OnStep          // Physics timestep (maps: FixedUpdate/_physics_process/Tick)
OnUpdate        // Per-frame (maps: Update/_process/Tick)
OnLateUpdate    // After updates (maps: LateUpdate/custom/Tick)
    ↓
OnDisable       // Object becomes inactive (maps: OnDisable/_exit_tree/EndPlay)
    ↓
OnDestroy       // Cleanup (maps: OnDestroy/custom/BeginDestroy)
    ↓
(Cleaned up)
```

**Event Mapping:**

```csharp
// Unified lifecycle events (wrapped in When, not directly exposed)
When.Self.Awakes(/* first setup */);
When.Self.Enables(/* when activated */);
When.Self.Steps(/* physics timestep */);
When.Self.Updates(/* per frame */);
When.Self.LateUpdates(/* after updates */);
When.Self.Disables(/* when deactivated */);
When.Self.Destroys(/* final cleanup */);
```

> **Note:** Lifecycle events are wrapped in `When` and not directly exposed to LunyScript users. Developers using Luny abstractions may utilize them directly for advanced scenarios.

**Adapter Behavior:**

| LunyScript Event | Godot              | Unity | Unreal |
|------------------|--------------------|-------|--------|
| Awakes | _ready()           | Awake | PostInitializeComponents |
| Enables | _enter_tree()      | OnEnable | BeginPlay |
| Steps | _physics_process() | FixedUpdate | Tick |
| Updates | _process()         | Update | Tick |
| LateUpdates | **(added)**        | LateUpdate | Tick |
| Disables | _exit_tree()       | OnDisable | EndPlay |
| Destroys | **(added)**        | OnDestroy | BeginDestroy |

**Special Note: Godot Destruction**

Godot lacks explicit destruction callbacks. LunyScript raises its own `OnDestroy` event when:
- Nodes are freed via `queue_free()` or `free()`
- LunyScript detects node removal from scene tree before final cleanup
- Custom adapter hooks track node lifecycle

```csharp
// In Godot adapter - LunyScript raises destruction event
public override void _ExitTree() {
    if (_isBeingDestroyed) {
        SendDestroyEvent(this);
    }
}
```

**Special Note: Godot LateUpdate**

Godot does not have a native late update phase. LunyScript may add its own `OnLateUpdate` event for Godot to maintain cross-engine consistency.

---

## Summary

LunyScript unifies three seemingly very diverse and unique conceptual models. But as the proof of concept has shown, the differences are superficial on a technical level. They can be unified in a straightforward manner by mere mapping and re-ordering.

1. **Scene Graph:** Treats GameObjects/Nodes/Actors uniformly as Entities
2. **Lifecycle:** Maps diverse event systems to consistent Initialize→Enable→Update→Disable→Destroy flow
3. **API Complexity:** Favors editor-driven design over runtime parameter tweaking

This enables truly portable gameplay code without sacrificing engine-specific capabilities. The overhead is minimal but varies between engines depending on how well they match the uniform behaviour.

Under consideration: Configurability of Lifecycle event ordering. In many cases the precise order of events simply does not matter, not even across engines.

> **TO BE REVIEWED:** Technical accuracy verification needed, especially for Godot destruction handling and Unreal component hierarchy mapping.
