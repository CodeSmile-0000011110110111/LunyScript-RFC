# Target Audience

## Who LunyScript Is For

### 🎓 Self-Learners & Hobbyists (PRIMARY AUDIENCE)

Want to explore game engines without the frustration of learning completely different APIs? Anxious about betting on the wrong horse?

**With LunyScript:**
- **Try all engines** - Your programming skills and code transfer completely
- **Fast results** - Less boilerplate, more game-making
- **Your own pace** - Start simple, grow into native APIs when ready
- **No regrets** - Switch engines without losing your hard-earned code knowledge
- **AI learning** - AI output you can actually understand and learn from

Perfect for Roblox creators wanting to "graduate" to pro engines, and anyone exploring which engine is the best fit.

### 📹 Tutorial Creators & "Learnfluencers" (HIGH IMPACT)

Stop making essentially the same tutorial and video three times. **Teach ONE API that works everywhere.** Teach gameplay patterns and have fun creating!

**With LunyScript:**
- **Reach all learners** - Unity **and** Godot audiences in one tutorial
- **Comparisons** - Show workflows side-by-side, help users decide and transition
- **AI-friendly teaching** - Fewer engine-specific and engine-version gotchas
- **Future-proof** - Your code curriculum doesn't break when engines update

If you teach game development on YouTube et al, LunyScript multiplies your reach while cutting your workload.

### 🏫 Formal Educators & Institutions

Teach **engine concepts** and **game design patterns**, not API memorization.

**With LunyScript:**
- One code curriculum across multiple engines
- Students compare editor workflows and choose tools, not languages
- Focus learning on design and workflows instead of API semantics
- Less confusion when switching engines mid-curriculum or with specializations
- Students graduate with transferable skills, not vendor lock-in

### 🔧 Framework & Tool Developers

([Share your needs](https://github.com/CodeSmile-0000011110110111/LunyScript-RFC/discussions))

Build **cross-engine solutions** instead of maintaining three separate plugins or compromising with fully engine-agnostic frameworks that can't leverage engine features.

**The Problem Today:**
- Systems for Dialogue, Quest, Inventory, Stats, Behaviour Trees, Statemachines: re-invented everywhere
- Portable frameworks lack engine integration, are challenging to set up: limiting their application
- Cross-Engine tools forced to write custom engine abstractions: [Articy](https://www.articy.com/en/articydraft/integration/), [Yarn Spinner](https://www.yarnspinner.dev/)

**With LunyScript:**
- Build once using LunyScript abstractions, deploy to Unity, Godot, ..
- Reach wider audiences with lower maintenance costs
- Leverage engine features through unified abstractions (audio, UI, animation, etc.)
- Simple API surface makes documentation clearer and AI code generation more reliable

### 🏢 Multi-Engine Studios

([Share your needs](https://github.com/CodeSmile-0000011110110111/LunyScript-RFC/discussions))

**With LunyScript:**
- Share gameplay code across projects using different engines
- More flexible staffing - developers aren't siloed by engine expertise
- Faster onboarding when switching between engine-specific projects

---

## Who This Is NOT For

**❌ You DON'T need LunyScript if:**
- You're already productive in your chosen engine and don't plan to switch
- You work on the high-end (AAA titles, competitive multiplayer, complex simulations)
- You require bleeding-edge engine features from day 1

**LunyScript is a teaching tool and productivity layer for gameplay scripting, not a replacement for engine-native programming.**
