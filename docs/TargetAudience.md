### 📹 Tutorial Creators & "Learnfluencers" (HIGH IMPACT & MULTIPLIERS)

Stop making essentially the same tutorial three times. Teach ONE API that works everywhere and multiply your reach.

**With LunyScript:**
- **Reach all learners** - Unity **and** Godot audiences in one tutorial
- **Comparisons** - Show workflows side-by-side, help users decide and transition
- **Future-proof** - Your code curriculum doesn't break when engines update
- **Captivate** - Explain less code, show more things that are working
- **Have fun** - Experiment, go crazy, entertain viewers

If you teach game development on YouTube, LunyScript multiplies your reach while cutting your workload.

## Who Will Also Enjoy LunyScript

### 🏫 Formal Educators & Institutions

Teach engine concepts and game design patterns, not API memorization. One curriculum works across all engines.

**With LunyScript:**
- **One curriculum** - Teach once, deploy to multiple engines
- **Tool comparison** - Students compare editor workflows and choose tools, not languages
- **Focus on design** - Less time on API semantics, more on game design patterns
- **Transferable skills** - Students graduate with portable knowledge, not vendor lock-in

Your students learn game development concepts that transfer across any engine they choose.

### 🎨 Visual Scripters

Tired of dragging nodes around? Want the benefits of text-based code without the intimidation factor?

**With LunyScript:**
- **Readable as intent** - Code reads like what you want to happen, not implementation details
- **Copy-paste friendly** - Move code blocks around effortlessly, see more at a glance
- **Gentle learning curve** - Start with simple one-liners, grow at your own pace
- **Version control** - See exactly what changed in git diffs
- **Easy refactoring** - Use the IDE, Luke!
- **Real programming** - Gain transferable coding skills while staying productive

A bridge into "real programming" for 'visual' users — you know you'd prefer text if it weren't for the syntax overload.

### 🎮 Prototypers & Game Jammers

Build playable prototypes quickly without accumulating technical debt. Test ideas across multiple engines without rewriting logic.

**With LunyScript:**
- **Less boilerplate** - No component setup, event registration, or coroutine management
- **Debug Half-Asleep** - When you're sleep-deprived, clear code and visibility matter
- **Engine flexibility** - Prototype in the faster engine, then build in the more capable engine
- **Post-jam value** - Extension code written in jams has a high probability of being production fit

Game jams demand fast results — LunyScript removes friction between idea and implementation.

---

### 🔧 Framework & Tool Developers

Build cross-engine solutions instead of maintaining three separate plugins or compromising with fully engine-agnostic frameworks that can't leverage engine features.

**With LunyScript:**
- **Build once** - Use LunyScript abstractions, deploy to Unity, Godot, and future engines
- **Wider reach** - Support multiple engines with lower maintenance costs
- **Engine features** - Leverage audio, UI, animation through unified abstractions
- **Better documentation** - Simple API surface makes docs clearer and AI generation more reliable

Stop reinventing dialogue systems, inventories, and AI logic for every engine — build once, publish everywhere.

### 🏢 Multi-Engine Studios

Share gameplay code across projects using different engines without rewriting logic for each one.

**With LunyScript:**
- **Shared codebase** - Gameplay code works across projects built with different engines
- **Flexible staffing** - Developers aren't siloed by engine expertise
- **Faster onboarding** - Switching between engine-specific projects becomes trivial
- **Reduced training** - One API to learn instead of multiple engine-specific patterns
- **Less Risk** - Build expertise with another engine on a real project

Step up from being a "all eggs in one engine" agency, expand client reach without doubling your costs.

## Who This Is NOT For

**❌ You DON'T need LunyScript if:**
- You're already productive in your chosen engine and don't plan to switch
- You work on the high-end (AAA titles, competitive multiplayer, complex simulations)
- You require bleeding-edge engine features from day 1

**LunyScript is a teaching tool and productivity layer for gameplay scripting, not a replacement for engine-native programming.**
