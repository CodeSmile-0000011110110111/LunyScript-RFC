# Design Decisions

This directory contains architectural and design decisions made during LunyScript development.

## Format

Each decision follows this structure:
- **Number** - Sequential (001, 002, ...)
- **Title** - Brief, descriptive
- **Date** - When decided
- **Status** - Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Decision** - What was decided
- **Reasoning** - Why this choice
- **Implications** - What it affects
- **Rejected alternatives** - What was considered but rejected

## Purpose

Record decisions to:
- Recall reasoning later ("why didn't I...? oh yeah right")
- Onboard contributors efficiently
- Avoid relitigating settled questions
- Learn from past choices

## Index

- [001 - Naming Scheme](001-naming-scheme.md) - Luny, LunyScript, LunyScript.{Engine} namespaces
