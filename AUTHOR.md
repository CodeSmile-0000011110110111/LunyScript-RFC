# About the Author

## My Personal Experience

- **1999** - Used visual state machines in my first game designer job (8+ GameBoy titles)
- **2002** - Created a declarative, state machine-based Lua script API (SpellForce, BattleForge)
- **2009** - Shipped three main titles and three add-ons, all heavily scripted. Onboarding was easy.
  - Script logic was 1-3% runtime CPU usage. The key? Lua transforms to native C++ on map load.
- **2010** - Worked freelance, wrote several game engine books (Learn cocos2d, Learn SpriteBuilder)
- **2015** - Began working on digital marketing projects. Unity only.
- **2022** - Began creating FOSS projects. For fun. With an estranged feeling that _something is missing_.
- **2025** - Spent half a year integrating Lua in Unity...

## The Realization

I made the same mistake as GDScript, UnityScript, UnrealScript!

I thought: first the entire API. Then I can add a simple layer.

**Now I'm convinced: we need the simple API first and foremost.**
