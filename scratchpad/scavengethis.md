## Key Benefits
- **Learn once, apply anywhere:** Learnings and language transfer. As onramp and for comparative analysis.
- **Empowers Designers:** More efficient than visual scripting. Easy to extend. VCS friendly.
- **Ecosystem risk mitigation:** Prep for next "runtime fee" debacle. Logic as portable as assets!
- **Cost efficient:** Reusable code libraries emerge naturally, even on tight schedules without senior staff.
- **Minimal overhead:** Marginal (5%), with potential for gains via internalized caching.
- **Add-in solution:** Add at any time, use selectively.

# Use Cases

Works great for:
- **Education:** One curriculum to teach them all. Avoid overwhelming non-coders.
- **Indies:** Create 'recipe games' faster, more opportunities to add 'your charm'
- **Game Jam / Prototyping:** Be fast, have fun, AND walk away with more reusable code blocks
- **Digital Marketing:** Low interactivity == simple code. Engine mandated? Reduce 'unknown API' risk.
- **Learnfluencers:** "Head to Head" comparisons are demanding but cater to larger audiences.
- **Research:** Defer API evaluation. Trial UI, Workflows, Platforms first.
